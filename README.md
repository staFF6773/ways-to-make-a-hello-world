# ways-to-make-a-hello-world

This repository collects a fascinating variety of extremely unnecessary methods for printing "Hello, World" in various programming languages. These examples were selected for their creativity and weirdness, and although you will probably never need them in a real project, they can be interesting to explore the idiosyncrasies of each language.

## List of available programming languages

In this list there are all the examples of how not to make a hello world but in different programming languages.

- [golang](https://github.com/staFF6773/ways-to-make-a-hello-world/tree/main/golang)
- [javaScript](https://github.com/staFF6773/ways-to-make-a-hello-world/tree/main/javaScript)
- [rubylang](https://github.com/staFF6773/ways-to-make-a-hello-world/tree/main/rubylang)

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to provide a fun and unconventional perspective on how a task as simple as printing a basic greeting can be performed in different programming environments. Each code snippet here presents a unique and often quirky solution to the classic "Hello, World" problem.

## Content

In this repository you will find:

- Examples in well-known and lesser-known programming languages.
- Methods that use obscure or little-used features of the language.
- Solutions that defy common conventions and show the versatility of the code.

## Warning

Warning! Most of these examples are purely educational and should not be considered best practices for actual software development. Some may even break style conventions and good programming practices.
